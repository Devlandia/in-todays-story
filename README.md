# In today's story...

we saw that everyday we learn something new and how important is to share this new acquired knowledge with our friends.  
And for that we built this _magic castle_ to keep everything we learn.

Here all _books_ and _scrolls_ are stored in folders. You can use a existing folder to store something you found or create a new one in case no one had found something similar yet.

Remember to keep the _castle_ clean and neat and everything in its place.

#### Until next time...
